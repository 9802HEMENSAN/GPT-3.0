# 4. **Sum and Average**: Write a Python program that calculates and prints the sum and average of a list of numbers.
#     - *Input*: [10, 20, 30, 40]
#     - *Output*: "Sum: 100, Average: 25.0"

# Define the list of numbers
# Calculate the sum of the numbers
# Calculate the average of the numbers
# Print the sum and average
numbers= [10, 20, 30, 40]
sumOfNumbers= sum(numbers)
averageOfNumbers=  sumOfNumbers/len(numbers)
print(f"Sum: {sumOfNumbers}, Average: {averageOfNumbers}")
